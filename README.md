# chameleon_translation
Machine Translation toolkits rely on numerous hyperparameters. Normally a user will not specify every possible value and toolkits will use default configurations. However, when attempting to replicate models and results, especially across different toolkits, this creates major issues. This project maps hyperparameters to a common yaml format and can read and generate scripts for numerous toolkits.
